## FAQs

### **1. Can I use these Capstone Projects in my job interviews?**
Yes! The purpose of these Capstone Projects is to create something unique and showcase your own work. Unlike course projects with solution codes, these Capstone Projects are entirely your creation.

Capstone Projects can:
- Be added to your portfolio.
- Help set you apart from other developers.

When hiring developers, employers prioritize practical projects over formal qualifications.

---

### **2. What if I donâ€™t remember how to do something?**
That's okay! Watching a tutorial doesn't guarantee mastery. These projects are designed to:
- Highlight your knowledge gaps.
- Encourage revisiting previous lessons and online documentation to improve skills.

Remember, as a professional developer, learning and troubleshooting are part of the process.
